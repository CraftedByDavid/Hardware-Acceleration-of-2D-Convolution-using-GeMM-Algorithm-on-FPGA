# Hardware-Acceleration-of-2D-Convolution-using-GeMM-Algorithm-on-FPGA
Hardware acceleration of 2D convolution for CNNs on FPGA using GEMM. This project is the first module of a reconfigurable accelerator for lightweight CNNs, enabling fast inference, low power, and efficient FPGA resource usage. Includes modular hardware design, testbench verification, and performance evaluation.
